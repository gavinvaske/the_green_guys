                <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Matt Mitchell</strong> and I am the landscape designer for The Green Guys. I have been in this position since we founded the company in 2009 out of our garage. Since the early days, my desire has been to help our customers establish a relationship with the land they call home. I graduated from Iowa State in May of 2020 with a degree in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies. This education launched me into a deeper understanding of humans, our environment, and the spaces that we can create for both. Being outside brings me great joy especially when plants get involved â˜º I am currently working part-time as a designer since most of my time is spent at the Ames Romero House where I am a house supervisor. If you are interested in any level of outdoor design to take place on your property, give me a call! I love unique and challenging opportunities.</p>
